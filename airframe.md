# Custom Airframe
## Overview

- Flight computer enclosure.
- Flight computer mount.
- Fin redesign.
- Thermocouple routing + mount.
- Casing extension.

We are using Onshape as our CAD software for designing mechanical
changes and interfaces.

The project is freely accessible

## Flight computer

### Enclosure
First an enclosure was designed,
with some tolerance for the battery
to allow for swelling and extra room
for the antenna.

Before continuing this design, we
will first assemble the flight computer
when the electronics and PCB arrive, 
then use a 3D printer to iterate and 
check the fit of the enclosure.

### Mount
We had the idea of using a coupler,
with mounting points connecting to
the enclosure, so the enclosure can
be slid in and out of the coupler.
Again, some iteration TBD.
