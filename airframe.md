# Custom Airframe
## Overview

- Flight computer enclosure.
- Flight computer mount.
- Fin redesign.
- Thermocouple routing + mount.
- Casing extension.

We are using Onshape as our CAD software for designing mechanical
changes and interfaces.

The project is freely accessible

## Flight computer

### Enclosure
First an enclosure for the flight
computer was designed. This mounts
the flight computer to the airframe
with some tolerance for the battery
to allow for swelling and extra room
for the antenna.

This enclosure worked well, with no
further design changes needed.

Some revision may be needed if shifts
are noticed in the first flight.

### Camera mount
Additionally in the Onshape project,
a mount was made for a camera. This 
will need a cut-out in the airframe
for a plastic cover, to prevent the
camera being sucked out during flight
due to a pressure difference.

To avoid the mount being visible in
the video, a reference grid was drawn
with some photos taken of the camera's
viewing angle. This informed the cut
out angle of the camera's lens.

This is shown below:
