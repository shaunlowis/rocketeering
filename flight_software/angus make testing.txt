MUST compile only 1 file at a time.

#The macros below are to keep the header files
#(which want to see a specific compiler and processor) happy. As they require the micro type to be defined
-D__CSMC__ -DSTM8S007

-I gives the include path to find the .h files for the C Preprocessor. MUST BE / NOT \    Also need to explicitely specify the current directory with -I.

-mstm8 to generate code for stm8 MCUs

-L gives the path to search for .lib files. MUST be absolute path
