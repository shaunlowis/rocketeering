# Overview

Build a custom 1/4 scale patriot missile. We are starting with an airframe that I assembled in 2019,
adding custom software and hardware to it.

- Custom flight computer designed and made.
- Enclosure and mount for flight computer.
- I-class motor will be used for the first launch.
- Embedded software developed for flight computer.
- Initial flight data recorded and analysed.

For successive flights, we plan to use
a custom sugar motor, with some changes
to the airframe.
