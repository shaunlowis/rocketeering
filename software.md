## Embedded software

Frankly, the STM8S was a mission to get working.

You can choose between a very old toolchain, using
the free cosmic compiler and stm8 IDE, or setting
things up yourself with VS Code and [SDCC](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).

Luckily for you reader, I now have a functional VS Code setup,
earned through blood sweat and tears.

Check out the [FC_dev branch](

 ) for further details.
